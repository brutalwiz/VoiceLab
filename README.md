# VoiceLab (Student Project)
Audio Processing Project using MaxMSP and Arduino (Teensy) Base.

Voice Lab is a MIDI Controlled Interface designed to fit on a Microphone 
to grant the user direct controls over Voice Effect Parameters.
The User has three touch sensitive buttons for Parameter Control which are 
connected to the Teensy Microcomputer. This will deliver MIDI information
to the MaxMSP patch which then adjustes the Audio Effects and directly
the Voice Signal from a Microphone.
